# Digital clock
 This is a practice program to get me back into writing code, I will be using notepad++ to keep me focused on writing
 quality code without using Emmet or any other tools that helps me write code faster.
 The purpose of me using Notepad++ is for me to write code and understand it better and getting the basics right. I am 
 using a 3 level process of writing each project that requires me to build on what I have learnt before. 

The first level are SIMPLE projects they are easy projects that requires list than 200 lines of code and does only 1 to 2 
thing really well but generally less than 5 things. The next level is the INTERMEDIATE level and this level requires me to
build a project that does more than 5 things but less that 10 in one application really well. These kind of projects would
generally have more than 200 lines of code but less than 500 lines. The last level of projects will be the CAPSTONE projects
and they would consist of 10 items that is being done really well and it will consist of full-stack applications. These
projects will have more than 500 lines.

The Digit-clock is the first project of my simple projects I will be building in notepad++, I will use these projects to 
help me with building my skills further in problem solving and cerment my knowledge of JS. I will use one SIMPLE project
and build on it adding more and more things to it pushing my knowledge and problem solving skills at building a solid 
CAPSTONE project.

Things I learnt within this build.
	- Writing clean code without using Emmet and auto filling my code.
